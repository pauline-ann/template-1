# Plant Store Template 


## Backstory


ğŸŒ¿ I created this website to practice my skill in web design and frontend development.

ğŸŒ¿ I enjoy the aesthetic of plant store websites I've been seeing and was inspired to try to create my own!

## Final Product

ğŸŒ¿ Very simple single page website with a color palette based off the header image. The color palette is cohesively used throughout the page for fonts and backgrounds.

ğŸŒ¿ Design goals were to keep it minimal, intuitive, and modern, yet warm and inviting.
