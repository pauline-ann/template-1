# Plant Store Template 


## Backstory


🌿 I created this website to practice my skill in web design and frontend development.

🌿 Being a plant mom, I chose to develop a website describing a fictional plant store. I enjoy the aesthetic of online plant stores I've been seeing and was inspired to try to create my own!

## Final Product

🌿 Very simple single page website with a color palette based off the header image. The color palette is cohesively used throughout the page for fonts and backgrounds.

🌿 Design goals were to keep it minimal, intuitive, and modern, yet warm and inviting.
