# Plant Store Template 


##Backstory


ðŸŒ¿ I created this website to practive my skill in web design as well as in frontend development.

ðŸŒ¿ I chose to develop a website describing a fictional plant store since aside from being a plant mom, I've been enjoying the aesthetic of online plant stores and I wanted to try creating my own!

##Final Product

ðŸŒ¿ Very simple single page website with a color palette based off the header image. Palette is used for coloring of fonts and backgrounds throughout.

ðŸŒ¿ Design goals were to keep it minimal and modern, yet warm and inviting.
