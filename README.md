# Plant Store Template 


##Backstory


ðŸŒ¿ I created this website to practice my skill in web design as well as in frontend development.

ðŸŒ¿ I chose to develop a website describing a fictional plant store since aside from being a plant mom, I enjoy the aesthetic of online plant stores I've been seeing. I was inspired to try creating my own!

##Final Product

ðŸŒ¿ Very simple single page website with a color palette based off the header image. The color palette is cohesively used throughout the page for fonts and backgrounds.

ðŸŒ¿ Design goals were to keep it minimal, intuitive, and modern, yet warm and inviting.
